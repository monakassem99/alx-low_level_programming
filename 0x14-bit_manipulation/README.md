Bitwise Operation
Ø Computers represent all data internally as sequences of
bits.
Ø Each bit can assume the value 0 or the value 1.
Ø The bitwise operators are used to manipulate the bits of
integral operands both signed and unsigned.
Ø Unsigned integers are normally used with the bitwise
operators.
Ø Bitwise manipulations are machine dependent
